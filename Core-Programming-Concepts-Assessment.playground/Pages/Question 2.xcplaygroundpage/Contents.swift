 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating software for a book publisher.
 
 Your app needs to track the following information for a given book:
 
 - Book name: the name of the book being published
 - Copies sold: the number of copies sold
 - Author name: the name of the book's author
 - Selling price: the suggested price that bookstores should sell the book for
 - Year published: the year that the book was first published in

 **For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).**
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.**
 
 */
// Answer question 2 below
// Define all the elements
let theNameOfTheBook = "Alisa's book"
var copiesSold = 10
let theNameOfTheAuthor = "Alisa"
var sellingPrice = 100
let yearPublished = "2018"

// The reason to choose
print("Constants can be something that will not be able to change such as a name of a time.")
print("So I used constants for the name, author, and the year")
print("Variable can be something that may change and a number")
print("So I used variables for the amount sold and the price")
